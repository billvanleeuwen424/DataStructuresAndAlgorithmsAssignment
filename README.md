# Snakes and Cats Simulation

Designed as a "Game", we are using this code to demonstrate understanding of Data Structures, and object oriented programming.

Currently, this project contains a class structure of animals (bird, snake, cat), a working Linked list, and arraylist.

The main function of this program is to house a simulation of cats/snakes chasing birds, all of which are randomly generated.

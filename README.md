# Snakes and Cats Simulation

A class project for COIS-2020 Data Structures and Algorithms. This is a console application.

##### To view this project, you can just easily download the zip, and run it inside MS Visual Studio.



### Description:

The aim of this project was to demonstrate our clear understanding of Object Oriented Programming, ArrayLists and LinkedLists. We built and tested the data structures along with the methods inside of them. And to demonstrate this, a simulation was designed which contained Animals with subclasses Cats, Birds, and Snakes.

The birds fly around the map randomly, while the cats and snakes will follow the birds around. Cats and Snakes can only move in X and Y, while Birds can also move in Z. When in 'range' a cat/will eat a bird, and it will be destroyed. 

Once all of the birds are gone, the simulation will end and print how many rounds it took.



### What I learned/improved working on this project:

- Object Oriented Design and Programming
- C#
- Understanding of Arraylists and LinkedLists.
=======
Designed as a "Game", we are using this code to demonstrate understanding of Data Structures, and object oriented programming.

Currently, this project contains a class structure of animals (bird, snake, cat), a working Linked list, and arraylist.

The main function of this program is to house a simulation of cats/snakes chasing birds, all of which are randomly generated.
